## Introduction
**If you encounter any of the following situations:**
- **Systems/architectures not listed in this project**
- **Bugs in the testing process of this project**
- **Desire to minimize environment changes without modifying local configuration**
- **Need for more comprehensive testing**

**Please try [https://github.com/oneclickvirt/ecs](https://github.com/oneclickvirt/ecs/blob/master/README_EN.md) for testing**

### Compatibility Information

| Category | Supported Options |
|----------|------------------|
| **Fully Supported Systems** | Ubuntu 18+, Debian 8+, Centos 7+, Fedora 33+, Almalinux 8.5+, OracleLinux 8+, RockyLinux 8+, AstraLinux CE, Arch |

## Fusion_Monster_Description

This project is best executed in the `/root` path to avoid environmental dependency issues. It automatically updates package managers by default and should not be used in production environments. It's recommended to use the Go version mentioned earlier to ensure your local configuration remains unchanged.

The results of the "fusion monster" are saved in `test_result.txt` in the current directory. You can run it in `screen` or `tmux`, and you can exit the SSH login and check the file after some time to avoid test interruptions caused by unstable SSH connections.

**Sometimes when testing machines with extremely poor configurations, executing it this way can prevent SSH connection interruptions caused by outdated IO or CPU. If screen displays garbled characters, it's not a problem - the shared link results will not contain garbled text.**

Both the complete and simplified versions of the fusion monster will automatically upload results to pastebin and return a sharing link upon completion. If you want to exit during testing, press `Ctrl+C` to terminate the test. This will automatically exit and delete residual environment dependency files.

Example of testing the worst performing machine (completed in 47 minutes): [Link](https://github.com/spiritLHLS/ecs/blob/main/lowpage/README.md)

Although this project has built-in **CDN** support for **domestic** and **international** acceleration of server test environment installation and pre-made file downloads, loading may be slower in mainland China due to CDN connectivity or bandwidth limitations.

**For first-time users of this project, it is recommended to check the instructions: [Jump to](https://github.com/oneclickvirt/ecs/blob/master/README_NEW_USER.md)**

Other information:

<details>
<summary>Click to expand</summary>

Except for the original content marked, all other sections are borrowed and optimized versions, different from the original corresponding scripts.

All detection methods have been considered for parallel testing, and this technique has been used in some components, optimizing 2-3 minutes compared to normal sequential execution.

The system basic information test combines multiple sources with self-patched detection parts (sysctl, NAT type detection, concurrent ASN detection, etc.).

CPU testing uses sysbench scoring by default, not yabs' gb4 or gb5 (although geekbench isn't the default, you can specify common geekbench versions for testing via commands). Related explanations can be found in the Q&A at the end of the Go version fusion monster description.

IO testing includes two types: dd disk testing from lemonbench and fio disk testing from yabs. The former may have larger errors but tests quickly with no disk size limitations, while the latter is more accurate but slower with disk and memory size limitations.

Streaming media testing includes two types: a go-compiled binary file and a shell script version. Each has its own advantages and disadvantages; compare them as needed.

TikTok testing has both superbench and lmc999 versions. If one becomes ineffective, it may be updated to either version; refer to the latest script.

Return route testing uses a GO-compiled binary version and a PR version from a friend. Optimizations have been made to adapt to multiple IP lists and merge partial queries.

IP quality detection is completely original. If there are bugs or additional database sources, please raise them in issues. Generally, check the IP type in the IP2Location database. If port 25 is accessible for email, you can set up a post office.

The fusion monster's IP quality detection is simplified without querying Cloudflare threat scores. The personal original section's IP quality detection (or the IP quality detection command listed in the repository description) is the complete version.

Three-network speed testing uses a self-written script with the latest nodes and components when possible, along with backup third-party go version testing cores, providing self-updating speed test node lists and adaptive system environment testing.

Other third-party scripts are categorized in the third-party script section, where you can find various competitive scripts of the same type from different authors. If the fusion monster doesn't satisfy you or has errors, you can check that section.

The original script section contains personally created parts which may be worth checking occasionally for updates on niche or unique scripts.

VPS testing, VPS speed testing, VPS comprehensive performance testing, VPS return route testing, VPS streaming media testing, and all other test fusion scripts - this script integrates everything that can be integrated.
